                          Thank you so much for saving the whole weekend to help
                          us celebrate our wedding. Firstly, let us give you a
                          little information about the room and paying. We have
                          super limited space so when we say VIP, we mean it!
                          <br/><br/>
                          The Â£450 we are asking for each room covers you from
                          the Friday to the Monday, however you can come and go
                          as you please. The room will be yours the whole time
                          no matter how long you stay (although we recommend
                          staying the whole time because...duh?)

                            We really hope you can all join us for a weekend of fun.
                            Our current plan is to have a Friday potluck, Saturday
                            get married (eek!) and on Sunday a BYOB, hungover but
                            lovely, BBQ. Probably with a few leftovers from the
                            Friday and the Saturday too.<br/><br/>

                            You probably all do have at least one of our numbers
                            but just in case you can get us on:<br/><br/>
