                            I moved to Perth High School when I was 14 years old with romanticised ideas of getting the
                            school bus, soon to realise it wasnâ€™t that glamorous and I spent more time than I thought
                            chasing the damn thing along the road. Then I saw a boy who got on the other bus and next
                            thing you know we are getting married. I say next thing, I mean 14 years after meeting and
                            12 years after dating. So I guess the village buses do hold a bit of a romanticism.
