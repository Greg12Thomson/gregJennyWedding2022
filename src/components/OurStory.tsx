                            Greg and Jenny met when they were in third year at high school, but it wasnâ€™t
                            until after a summer of secret walks, side glances at parties and two years that
                            Greg plucked up the courage to ask her out across MSN. <br/><br/>
                            They have travelled all over the world, both together and independently, and have
                            amassed a total of 37 living and thriving house plants. <br/><br/>
                            On the day you join them to celebrate their marriage at Cambo Estate, they will
                            have been together for a total of 12 years. <br/><br/>
                            They cannot wait to share their day of love, food, dancing and drinks with you.
